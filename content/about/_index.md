# About

Developer Student Clubs are university based community
groups for students interested in Google developer
technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate
programs with an interest in growing as a developer are
welcome. By joining a DSC, students grow their knowledge in
a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for
local businesses and their community.

## What does being a part of DSC mean?

You can **connect** with other students on campus interested
in developer technologies. All are welcome, including those
with diverse backgrounds and different majors.

You can **learn** about a wide range of technical topics
where new skills are gained through hands-on workshops,
in-person training and project building activities. 

You can **apply** your new learnings and connections to
build great solutions for local problems. Advance your
skills, career and network. Give back to your community by
helping others learn as well.
