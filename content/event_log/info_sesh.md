# Info Session

DSC RV conducted their first event, on Saturday, the 3rd of
October. An Info Session to introduce the students of RV
College of Engineering to Club. The event was entirely
virtual owing to COVID-19.

We gave students a little insight into the events and
workshops that we have lined up for them this year, and a
briefing about the Solution Challenge. The second half of
the stream was dedicated to introducing our Core Team to the
audience:

 - DSC Lead: Akshay Oppiliappan
 - Co-Lead: Ambu Karthik
 - Technical Workshop Supervisor: Manjunath S Nayak
 - Marketing and Communications: Shubh Shukla
 - Machine Learning Domain expert: Syed Farhan Ahmed
 - Graphic Designer: Sai Keerthana Arun
 - Faculty Advisor: Prof. Girish Rao

Towards the end, we distributed a form to gauge the
student's demand for workshop topics. It was no surprise
that Machine Learning came out on top with Functional
Programming, a close second. The session managed to
successfully kindle interest in budding software engineering
enthusiasts.
